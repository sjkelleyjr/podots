        <h2>{{SITE_NAME}} Guidelines</h2>

        <p>{{SITE_NAME}} is a platform for podcast exploration.<br>
        It shall enable people to discover, share and discuss interesting thoughts, publications or web pieces about
        podcasts and podcasting.<br>
        On the platform, anybody shall feel welcomed.
        </p>


        <h3>Beautiful is better than ugly.</h3>
        <p>
        Be beautiful to each other. Always remember, {{SITE_NAME}} is a community built around podcasts. When discussing podcasts, there is no need to offend someone personally.  They're just podcasts.
        </p>

        <h3>Explicit is better than implicit.</h3>
        <p>Be on-topic. We are here to discuss the Python programming language, its ecosystem, its applications and
        its community. For off-topic discussions there are plenty of forums out there on the net. <br>
        This community regards political discussions as off-topic, unless discussion the walrus operator (just kidding).</p>

        <h3>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</h3>
        <p>Please think of a contribution of another member of this community as well-intended. We should all assume
        that people here behave nicely and respectful. </p>

        <!--<h3>Now is better than never.</h3>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Although never is often better than *right* now.</h3>
        <p></p>-->

        <h3>Errors should never pass silently.</h3>
        <p>We value transparency. If there is any action taken by moderators on submissions, comments or user accounts,
        we try to be as clear about what happened as possible. For now, there is no moderation system in place. This means
        that we might be forced to delete contributions silently when we notice off-topic, disrespectful or otherwise abusive
        content without further notice. However, a moderation audit trail is on the roadmap to be implemented soon</p>


        <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
        <p>This is a news aggregator and we all want to be nice to each other. Rude behavior in form of continuously spamming,
        posting off-topic content, or offending people ad-hominem, will result in a ban.</p>

        <!--Beautiful is better than ugly.
        Explicit is better than implicit.
        Simple is better than complex.
        Complex is better than complicated.
        Flat is better than nested.
        Sparse is better than dense.
        Readability counts.
        Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
        Although practicality beats purity.
        Errors should never pass silently.
        Unless explicitly silenced.
        In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
        There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
        Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
        Now is better than never.
        Although never is often better than *right* now.
        If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
        If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
        Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!-->
